    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <span id="about_block">
            <p id="about_all">We are seven happy people. If we were cast in a movie to accompany Show White, we’d share a given name. Behind us, however (behind us all), something sits, waiting and watching. We sing past it, to it, with it. Mostly we sing about it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On banjo there is Katie. She started this and we blame her for it by buying her beer. We can’t escape what she has created.
            </p>
            <p>
                On violin and sometimes vocals (and hopefully someday accordion) is Thalia. She improvises pretty much everything, from every song to her choice of flat cap. She’s been playing violin a long time, relative to her existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Relative to Thalia’s existence is Dan. He plays guitar not as well as some others, sings not as well as most others, and plays harmonica and jawharp to keep himself from singing and playing guitar too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                On many lead and backing vocals, and for good reason, is Mike. He’s also on many instruments for good reason, with more being revealed nearly every month. He’s a one-man band somehow at peace operating with a sometimes cacophonous seven-piece ensemble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chris is on (well, how should we put it?) Chris is on flute, and whistle, and piccolo. If he had his way (which he won’t) he’d also be on coconuts. That thing we sing about, and past, and with, it’s mostly there in those haunting beautiful sounds being produced by Chris.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrying the bottom and anchoring every passage is Joseph. It isn’t a standup bass and it’s like no bass you probably ever seen. It’s portable and it’s loud enough to rattle unanchored glasses off the bar, just as we like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                On percussion, guitar, vocals, and dulcister (look it up) is Adam. He thought he was joining the collective to play drums. Then someone handed him a guitar. Then someone handed him a dulcister. The rest is not yet history, but perhaps is history in the making.
