        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div id="about_block">
            <p id="about_all">A multi-generational group of former strangers who coalesced out of a meet-up for lovers of (primarily) gothic Anglo-American folk music.  <br>
                We are seven happy people. Behind us, however (behind us all), mortality sits, waiting and watching. We sing past it, to it, with it. Mostly we sing about it.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Katie</span> – banjo and vocals. She started this project as a meet-up to find like-minded souls to play songs from (and akin to) those from the <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>, despite being a Brit herself. Her AAFM-inspired mostly-clawhammer style evokes the gothic mystery of Appalachia, which in turn carried within it the often-dark corners of Britain and the Isles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Chris</span> – various winds – mainly flute, whistle, fife, and piccolo. If he had his way (which he won’t) he’d also be on coconuts. The mortality we sing and play about (and past, and with), it’s mostly there in those haunting beautiful sounds being produced by Chris. Despite this, he’s happiest playing traditional reels and dance tunes (and, from time to time, coconuts). 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Thalia</span> – violin and vocals (and someday accordion). An American ex-pat of Greco-Scandinavian heritage, well-versed in British, American, and Scandinavian fiddle, she improvises pretty much everything, from every song to her choice of flat cap. She’s been playing violin a long time, relative to her existence, and grew up hearing songs from the AAFM almost daily in her home. Too young to consider mortality seriously, but willing to put up with the concept if it means she gets to play reels and folk-dance tunes from time to time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Adam</span> – percussion, guitar, vocals, and dulcister (look it up). He thought we was joining the meet-up to play drums. Then he borrowed someone’s guitar. Then someone handed him a dulcister. He found the latter to be a songwriting machine, and he uses it to produce ballads well within the dark, murderous tradition of the Isles and Appalachia, despite only having been introduced to the AAFM through the meet-up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Mike</span> – lead and backing vocals and on multiple instruments. The most accomplished musician of the group, he’s a one-man band and locally known solo performer somehow at peace operating within a sometimes cacophonous seven-piece ensemble. Has a voice pretty enough to override the underlying darkness of what we typically play. Writes songs that evoke hope from hopelessness. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Dan</span> – harmonica, guitar, vocals, infrequent percussion, and occasional jawharp. Another American ex-pat, English Lit major, former rock music business wannabe whose musical perspective was transformed by the re-release of the <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i> in 1997. Plays and sings with more gusto than intricacy. The most mortality-focused, having seen its presence reach for him at least three times without success. He writes mortality-tinged songs for English majors to dissect. Also, father of Thalia.
