                        Broken walls that grin and gesture toward the huddled mumbling<br/>
                        Chosen few, who for the vesture cast their lots<br/>
                        Betting all to find the favour of a nearly empty pot<br/>

                        The drops are red though they hardly hit the clay<br/>
                        That once was fired and formed the framework of a soft ceramic day<br/>
                        And still contains the ashes of a memory<br/>
                        Mostly yours but then perhaps it was all the same to me<br/>
                    </p>
                    <p class="chorus_text">
                        [Chorus]<br/>
                        We watch the sky reflecting just the rain<br/>
                        Filling furrows in the fields of this barren plain<br/>
                        Where we tried to fix these jumbled crooked lines<br/>
                        Calling what’s yours is nothing, what’s yours is mine<br/>
                        But now…<br/>
